MetaGame is a Massive Online Coordination Game. An open-source framework for autonomous humans and decentralized organizations, to coordinate in creation and exchange of value with the least friction and most fun possible.

This is the repo for the MetaGame website.

## 🚀 Quick start

```shell
# clone repo
git clone https://github.com/MetaFam/MetaGame.git
# install dependencies
yarn
# start dev server
yarn start
```

## 🧐 What's inside?

Here are the top-level files and directories you'll see in a site created using the blog theme starter:

```
MetaGame
├── content
│ ├── assets
│ │ └── avatar.png
│ └── posts
│   └── hello-world.mdx
├── src
│ └── gatsby-plugin-theme-ui
│ └── components
│   │── header.js
│   │── layout.js
|   └── seo.js
├── .gitignore
├── .prettierignore
├── .prettierrc
├── gatsby-config.js
├── package.json
└── README.md
```

1.  **`/src`**: This directory will contain all of the code related to what you will see on the front-end of your site (what you see in the browser) such as your site header or a page template. `src` is a convention for “source code”.

2.  **`.gitignore`/`.prettierignore`**: These file tells git/prettier which files it should not track / format.

3.  **`.prettierrc`**: This file tells [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) which configuration it should use to lint files.

4.  **`gatsby-config.js`**: This is the main configuration file for a Gatsby site. This is where you can specify information about your site (metadata) like the site title and description, which Gatsby plugins you’d like to include, etc. (Check out the [config docs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/gatsby-config/) for more detail).

5.  **`package.json`**: A manifest file for Node.js projects, which includes things like metadata (the project’s name, author, etc). This manifest is how npm knows which packages to install for your project.
